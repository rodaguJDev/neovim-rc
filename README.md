# Keyboard Shortcuts
## Custom remaps
+ Move selection using `J` and `K`
+ `J` will not move the cursor to the end of the file
+ `Ctrl-D` and `Ctrl-U` does it's best to keep cursor in the middle
+ `<space>y` will copy line to the system clipboard (alias for "+y)
## LSP
+ `gd` - Go to definition
+ `gi` - Go to implementation
+ `K` - View hover with info about variable
+ `wa`, `wr`, `wl` - Workspace add, remove, list
+ `<leader>D` - Go to type definition of variable
+ `<leader>rn` - Rename Variable
+ `<leader>ca` - Code Action (LSP suggestions)
+ `<leader>vr` - Variable References
+ `<leader>f` - Format file

# Future Plans
1. Learn how to install [nvim_cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp)
  - The [LSP Zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim) repo also has a few details on how nvim-cmp works
